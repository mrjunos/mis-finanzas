# Project Rules

## Deployments and Major Changes
1. All deployments or major code changes MUST go through a code review process.
2. DO NOT deploy directly to production without user approval.
3. For each significant feature or fix, push the changes to a new branch and create a Pull Request on GitHub.
4. Notify the user to review the Pull Request before merging and deploying.
